# Prompts Used During Development

This is not a full transcript, but a simple list of the prompts I used while building the app.

I’m only including prompts I remember and that helped shape the app.

## 🧠 Early Planning

* "Which option is simpler but still effective for a take-home project?"
* "Give me a execution plan for Like Summary Project "
* "What does a clean backend design look like for this?"

## 🏗️ Backend Design

* "How should I organize services and controllers in an Express + TS app?"
* "What’s a good way to scrape multiple links and summarize them?"

## 🔎 Scraping + Extraction

* "Why do some sites return empty content with axios + cheerio?"
* "How can I safely extract readable text from HTML?"

## 🤖 LLM Integration

* "How should I write a prompt to get summary, key points, and conflicts?"

## 🧪 Debugging Issues

* "Why am I not getting valid sources?"
* "How do I debug scraping problems for specific URLs?"

## General Use Style

Most of the time, I used AI in a conversational way — asking follow-ups, exploring options, and solving problems step by step.
